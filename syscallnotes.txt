notes for system calls assignment 2 - operating systems
**********************************************************
- A SYSTEM CALL IS A CONTROLLED ENTRY POINT INTO THE KERNEL, ALLOWING THE PROCESS TO REQUEST AN ACTION FROM THE KERNEL ON THE PROCESSES BEHALF


- when you look at %rax or %eax, they stores the return result of the systemcall upon exit, upon entry stores the syscall number (orignial_rax orignial_eax)

- everytime a system call is made, wait() will return then the tracer will use ptrace(..,..,...),ect, to read registers and memory then store it in some user-level memory buffer
  while(1) is in infinite loop which ill run over and over, each time wait returns a syscall is made, so over and over registers and memory will be dumped into that memeroy buff
 
- everytime openat()(syscall), is called read() write() will operate on that file, based on that file discriptor returned, ALSO read() and write() will return file read/write 
  volume amounts, meaning: the amount of bytes written and read to the file

- an include .h file is giving a large list of system call numbers and their meanings, each syscall # is an int

- write gets a pointer to the buffer in it's () parameter feild which is where the writing is done, and a file discriptor
